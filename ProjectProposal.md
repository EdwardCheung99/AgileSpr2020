# Super Scheduler

## What and Why?

Super Scheduler will be an application that allows users to schedule their daily lives. People often need to keep track of multiple events throughout a day. Between classes, meetings, and get togethers with friends, it can be difficult for one person to keep their life organized. 

## For whom?
This application is designed for use by young adults, who may have issues with keeping track of their schedules on their own. Since younger people perform most of their daily tasks through technology, it would be more convenient for them to schedule and keep track of their lives through an online application.

## How?
With Super Scheduler, users will be able to mark events throughout the week. Users will name each scheduled event, while also specifying its time and date. In each event, a user will be able to specify a location, as well as list any required materials (for example, homework for a class). Furthermore, each event will allow users to add notes, in case there is something they need to know for the event ahead of time. Outside of simply scheduling events, users can create to-do checklists for specific dates. Rather than specify a time for these tasks, the user can simply check these tasks off when they are completed.

## Scope
Since Super Scheduler involves creating a detailed calendar that users can modify, it will be a good challenge for a small group. Beyond simply creating an interactive calendar, programmers will need to find out how to best incorporate events and a to-do list into the application. With all the features that are required, this project would be appropriate for one semester.
